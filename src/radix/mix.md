I'm implementing `operator+=` for a mixed-base number system, where each digit has its own base (e.g., `[10, 60, 60]` or `[2, 2, 2]`). The system is similar to a multi-digit counter, and I want to add a value (`carry`) to it.

Constraints:
- The digits are stored as a fixed-width integer type (e.g., `uint32_t`).
- I **can't use wider integer types** (like `uint64_t`) to avoid overflow.
- I want to handle **large carries** (not just `0` or `1`).
- I also want the carry to **wrap around** if needed (e.g. adding `1` to `[9, 59, 59]` should yield `[0, 0, 0]`).

Problem:
- Adding `digit + carry` can overflow if both are large and `T` is fixed-width.
- Modding and dividing the sum (`(digit + carry) % base`, `(digit + carry) / base`) becomes unsafe without widening.

Solution:
- Simulate the addition safely by splitting `carry` into what the current digit can take and what must be carried forward.
- Avoid overflowing `T` by using conditional logic rather than raw addition.

Here’s the logic for each digit (in pseudocode):

```
if carry >= base - digit:
    new_digit = carry - (base - digit)
    new_carry = 1 + (new_digit / base)
    new_digit = new_digit % base
else:
    new_digit = digit + carry
    new_carry = 0
```

Then update:
- `digit = new_digit`
- `carry = new_carry`
- move to the next digit (wrapping if needed)

This safely handles mixed-base addition without requiring wider types and properly wraps around on overflow.
